<h1>High Temperature 3D Printing (with nanotubes!)</h1>

<h2>Space printer, LESLIE, it had many names and only caught on fire once.</h2>

<p>This project was a part of an internship at NASA Langley which spanned over two consecutive summers.</p>

<p>We built:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A low-cost high temperature 3D printing platform using (modified) open-source components from the LulzBot series of printers.

<li><p>A large-format 3D printer with two gantries and six unique toolheads, one that stitches carbon nanotube yarn.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a picture of me and my team:</p>
