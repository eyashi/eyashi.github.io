<h1>3D Printer in a Vaccuum</h1>

<h2>Senior research project to emulate space environments for 3D printing.</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered what happens when you put a thermoplastic 3D printer under high vacuum?</p>

<p>Me too. So I proposed an independent study be done about it.</p>

<p>After a few months of research and a presentation at AeroDef in Fort Worth, Texas:</p>

<p>We found that it was just really tough to cool things down.</p>

<p>Here is a look at the unique water cooled extruder designed for the printer (if that doesn't look like undergraduate University funding, I don't know what does!)</p>
